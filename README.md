# Random image generator

Actually this repository has multiple different random image generators. Currently they are not looking great, but they certainly are random. Next thing to work on is to make them user some kind of patterns and make them look nicer.

## How to use

Open `index.html` with your browser. It should show one of the random image generations on the canvas. You can choose different ones by editing the `main.js`. Some image generator functions may take parameters that will modify how the random image is generated. Otherwise you have to actually go in to the generator script and modify how the images are made there. These configurations will be made easier at some point, hopefully.
